# Modular_Tic-tac-toe


A simple, clean, and modular Tic-Tac-Toe game in the C programming language.  
Designed for beginners, preparation, and GitHub portfolio projects.

 Functional Requirements :

- The game must run in a terminal.
- Board size is fixed at 3×3.
- Two players (X and O) take turns.
- Program must:
  - Display the board after every move.
  - Check for valid moves.
  - Detect wins (rows, columns, diagonals).
  - Detect draws (when the board is full).
  - Announce the result (X wins, O wins, or draw).
- Follow modular structure using functions:
  - Board()
  - printboard()
  - validmove()
  - makemove()
  - win()
  - full()


Features :

- Modular code with clean functions.
- No global input of X/O — player turns handled automatically.
- Input validation.
- Beginner-friendly design.
- Very short and readable code.
- Perfect for labs, class assignments, and GitHub.
